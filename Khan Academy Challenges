--#1. What are your favorite books? You can make a database table to store them in! In this first step, create a table to store your list of books. It should have columns for id, name, and rating.
CREATE TABLE booklist (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, rating INTEGER);
INSERT INTO booklist VALUES (1,"Dr. Suess", 4);
INSERT INTO booklist VALUES (2,"Bible", 1);
INSERT INTO booklist VALUES (3,"Cook Book", 5);
INSERT into booklist VALUES (4,"History", 3);
INSERT INTO booklist VALUES (5,"Harry Potter", 5);
INSERT INTO booklist VALUES (6,"Romeo and Juliet", 2);
INSERT INTO booklist VALUES(7,"Percy Jackson",4);
SELECT * FROM booklist 

--#2. This database contains an incomplete list of box office hits and their release year. In this challenge, you're going to get CREATE TABLE movies (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, release_year INTEGER);

INSERT INTO movies VALUES (1, "Avatar", 2009);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (2, "Titanic", 1997);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (3, "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope", 1977);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (4, "Shrek 2", 2004);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (5, "The Lion King", 1994);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (6, "Disney's Up", 2009);
SELECT * FROM movies;
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE release_year > 2000  ORDER BY release_year ASC;the results back out of the database in different ways! In this first step, just select all the movies.

--#3.Here's a table containing a TODO list with the number of minutes it will take to complete each item. Insert another item to your todo list with the estimated minutes it will take.
CREATE TABLE todo_list (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, item TEXT, minutes INTEGER);

SELECT SUM(minutes) FROM todo_list

--#4. Ever sung karaoke? It's a place where you sing songs with your friends, and it's a lot of fun. We've created a table with songs, and in this challenge, you'll use queries to decide what songs to sing. For the first step, select all the song titles.
CREATE TABLE songs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    artist TEXT,
    mood TEXT,

SELECT title FROM songs;
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" OR released > 1990;
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" AND released > 1990 AND duration < 240;

--#6. We've created a database of a few popular authors and their books, with word counts for each book. In this first step, select all the authors who have written more than 1 million words, using GROUP BY and HAVING. Your results table should include the 'author' and their total word count as a 'total_words' column.
CREATE TABLE books (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    author TEXT,
    title TEXT,
    words INTEGER);
